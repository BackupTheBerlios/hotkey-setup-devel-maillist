I've had a good read through them but mostly only noticed minor spelling
mistakes---I'm impressed, thank you!  There's one mention of 'xkb_alias.py'
which isn't included;  maybe remove the note as it's sounds exciting!

These are ones that aren't built-in (eg. non laptops)?

The reduced polling patch should cope with some of the excessive CPU usage
on recent LenovoPads---Mark was complaining about that after getting an
X60s.  One of the thoughts I had was varying the polling rate between
different keys;  the brightness is handled in hardware (and sometimes one of
the keys also generates an ACPI event aswell).

The feedback for Brightness/ThinkLight is already visual and the key presses
are merely a hint for the new status to be displayed.  Response time is not
critical as the resulting number of brightness steps is absolute.

Volume is sometimes handled in hardware, but ideally I want to find an
additional way of handling this so that the ALSA and hardware mixer
(including mute) are always kept in step (the daft GNOME asymmetric volume
control really needs backing out)[0].  This should be fairly responsive.

The other two (Zoom/Mode Switch) and Access IBM can probably be semi low
priority aswell---but these do need to activate events /before/ the user
decides that nothing has happened and pushes them again!

&gt;<i> Just FYI: FC will change from dmidecode to hal for detecting make and model.
</I>
I'm fine for this aswell, as long as it doesn't break the existing working
cases---I think there is the odd case were I resorted to some fairly
desparate matching.

One issue I'm unsure about (it's a policy decision and I hate those).  I've
recently been given a clone Mac keyboard which is fine as a normal layout
(&quot;PC layout&quot;) however the layout on the keyboard is such that Print-Screen
and friends are labelled 'F13/F14/F15'.  The completely mad thing is
'Insert' being labelled as 'Help'.

What are we aiming for, to have detect the USB ID of this keyboard and to
patch that help to box-of-the-box generate exactly what it says on the key,
in this case 'Help'?

[0] mpt (usability guy) suggests that whilst the idea of the asymmetric
volume decreasing faster than increasing is a nice one (you are often eager
to turn it down)---it's the implementation is wrong. The *repeat-rate* of
the volup/voldown keys should be adjusted, not the amount of effect they
have.  Ideally:

  Press VolUp   ~14 times and get Maximum Volume.
  Press VolDown ~14 times and get Minimum Volume.
  Hold VolUp    ~ 5 seconds and get Maximum Volume (still 14 steps)
  Hold VolDown  ~ 3 seconds and get Minimum Volume (still 14 steps)

This is hard to do as the repeat-rate is normally handled by hardware.
